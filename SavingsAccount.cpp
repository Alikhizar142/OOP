/*Create a SavingsAccount class. Use a static data member annualInterestRate to store the annual interest rate for each of the savers. 
Each member of the class contains a private data member savingsBalance indicating the amount the saver currently has
on deposit. Provide a member function calculateMonthlyInterest that calculates the monthly
interest by multiplying the balance by annualInterestRate divided by 12; this interest should be
added to savingsBalance. Provide a static member function modifyInterestRate that sets the
static annualInterestRate to a new value. Write a driver program to test class SavingsAccount.
Instantiate two different objects of class SavingsAccount, saver1 and saver2, with balances of
$2000.00 and $3000.00, respectively. Set the annualInterestRate to 3 percent. Then calculate
the monthly interest and print the new balances for each of the savers. Then set the
annualInterestRate to 4 percent, calculate the next monthâ€™s interest and print the new balances
for each of the savers*/
